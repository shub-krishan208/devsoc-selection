# Developer's Society: Selection Tasks

_**Under construction 🏗️**_

## Task 1: Lost and Found API

Task summary ... My take on it.

- We need a admin panel for this thing too for database handling ... will user adminjs for this purpose.

Why do we need the login setup again ... ? So that the admins can moderate the listings ... and do the users need to login?? Well ... I'll make a login setup for everyon but the login taken is to be role based ... something like Bearer 'role' hash ...

- need to make admin functions for db moderation (using adminjs would've been easier)
- make items endpoints.

## TODO

- follow through the last gemini prompt and we're done for this one.
